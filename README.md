It is a simple dynamic web app which is generating random Memes images after clicking the button. The user can type his own text at the top and the bottom of the image. It is built in order to learn React basics:

- learned how to add an event listeners
- state
- forms
- learned how to use useEffect() hook to handle side effects
- fetching data from the API (it gets 100 of the most popular meme images)
- styling (using CSS classes)
